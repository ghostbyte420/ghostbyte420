### 🌍 About Me
I’m an old school gamer who grew up on a mix of text-based games from the 80s and pixelated games from the 90s...

- 🎮 **Game Development**: this has been kind of a go-nowhere hobby of mine. It keeps my brain active so I can't complain
- 🗺️ **Procedural Generation**: Creating tools for fractal land generation, map design, and script exports for **RunUO/ServUO/uoAvox**
- 🛠️ **UI/UX**: Advocate for drag-and-drop interfaces, customizable UI elements, and intuitive designs to make my hobby easier
- 🤖 **AI Integration**: I'm no code-guru, so any advantage I can get helps! AI exploration has been phenominal!!

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I'm not here for you. I code for me. If you like what I am doing here and appreciate my work then say thanks. If not, don't complain. 
Everything on my GitHub is open source; I provide it As-Is. 

If you find fault with my work then you can always take it and fix it, OR you can send me a message with either code or suggestions
that will fix whatever problems you have. Otherwise there is always a ficticious HR department I don't answer to; yeah talk with 
them and maybe you'll see results, but I wouldn't hold your breath.
